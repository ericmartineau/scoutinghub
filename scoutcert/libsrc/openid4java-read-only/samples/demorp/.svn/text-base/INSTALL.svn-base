... OpenID Demo RP - featuring Attribute Exchange and OpenID Infocards

========================================================================

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS


=> Introduction:

This document describes how to install, configure and use the sample
OpenID Demo Relying Party.

The Relying Party requires an OpenID Identifier for login; the identifier
is requested and can be provided through either of the following
two mechanisms:

   - the regular form-based text entry

   - using OpenID Information Cards


=> OpenID Infocard login

The OpenID protocol transactions are enhanced with the use of a
client-side (Information Card) Identity Selector, as described in:

    https://openidcards.sxip.com/spec/openid-infocards.html

The Relying Party's login page contains an additional
"application/x-informationCard" <OBJECT> element
(see www/WEB-INF/jsp/login.jsp).

The Relying Party extracts the OpenID Authentication Response
from the xmlToken parameter POST'ed by Identity Selector, after
which point the regular OpenID (direct) verification is performed.


=> Configuration:

    www/WEB-INF/classes/config.properties :

    - base.url : The base URL (without the context path)
                 where the RP will be deployed


=> Build and Installation:
