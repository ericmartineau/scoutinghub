.... OpenID4Java Library - README

========================================================================

What is this package?

OpenID4Java is a Java Library originally developed by Sxip Identity, 
licensed under Apache 2.0.

The library currently supports the following OpenID specifications:

	- OpenID Authentication 2.0
	- OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0
	- OpenID Simple Registration 1.0 and 1.1
	- OpenID Provider Authentication Policy Extension 1.0
	- OpenID Information Cards 1.0, draft 1

OpenID starts with the concept that anyone can identify themselves on the 
Internet the same way websites do - with a URI. Since URIs are at the very 
core of Web architecture, they provide a solid foundation for user-centric 
identity.

The first piece of the OpenID framework is authentication -- how you prove 
ownership of a URI. Today, websites require usernames and passwords to 
login, which means that many people use the same password everywhere. With 
OpenID Authentication, your username is your URI, and your password (or 
other credentials) stays safely stored on your OpenID Provider (which you 
can run yourself, or use a third-party identity provider).

For more information about the OpenID protocol please refer to the
specification at:
